# SARA Torque Measurement Testing Jig

## 📡 Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Sun-Pointing Attitude Regulation Assembly (SARA) Torque Measurement Testing Jig**. This project focuses on the conceptual and functional design of a specialized testing jig developed to measure the torque output of the stepper motor-driven mechanism in SARA, a CubeSat subsystem designed to optimize solar energy intake through precise sun-tracking capabilities.

The testing jig is engineered based on **Advanced Mechanical Design Methods**, ensuring accurate, repeatable, and reliable performance validation. The system simulates real-world load conditions encountered in space while eliminating environmental interferences like temperature fluctuations and gravitational effects.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **🗜️ Modular Rotational Base:** Adaptable to various CubeSat models for versatile testing.
- **⚙️ Torque Measurement System:** Utilizes strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, connected to a differential amplifier for precise torque readings.
- **☀️ Sunlight Simulation:** Dual-lamp setup with light sensors to mimic solar intensity variations.
- **🧠 Microcontroller Control:** Arduino Mega for data acquisition and control, with potential upgrades to custom PCBs.
- **🛡️ Safety Protocols:** Integrated overload protection and emergency stop mechanisms.
